<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name's Panagiotis and I'm from Greece. I've studied Electronics Engineering and in early 2023, I decided to focus on Front End Web Development. This page is part of a Udemy course, which aims to help newcomers to web development and build up a portfolio. Pretty surprised you're actually here and keep reading this. In my free time I review games for VG24.gr as I've been playing videogames since I was a kid. Seriously, you can leave now, there's no more info.</p>
